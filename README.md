# DevOps Poll App ðŸš€

This is a simple **polling application** deployed on AWS using **Terraform + ECS + RDS + ALB**.

## Features
- Flask app with MySQL backend
- Containerized with Docker
- Terraform modules for VPC, ECS, RDS, and ALB
- CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
- Stores Terraform state in S3 with DynamoDB lock

## Deployment

### 1. Prerequisites
- AWS account
- Terraform >= 1.5
- Docker installed
- GitHub repo with secrets:
  - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
  - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

### 2. Clone Repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/youruser/devops-poll.git
cd devops-poll


*** Security intergrated ***

ðŸ”’ Security in this Project
1. AWS Security Groups

RDS security group:

Allows inbound traffic only from the ECS task security group (not open to the public).

Ensures database is not exposed to the internet.

ECS/EC2 security group:

Allows inbound HTTP/HTTPS from the load balancer only.

Outbound traffic is restricted to required services (RDS, ECR, updates).

2. Database Credentials & Secrets

Credentials for RDS (username, password, DB name) are not hardcoded.

Instead:

Stored in Terraform variables, ideally injected via GitHub Actions secrets.

ECS Task Definition passes them as environment variables.

âœ… This way, poll.py connects to the DB securely with no credentials inside the repo.

3. ECS Task Role & Execution Role (IAM)

ECS Task Execution Role:

Only allows pulling images from ECR + pushing logs to CloudWatch.

ECS Task Role:

Grants only the permissions needed (e.g., talk to RDS if IAM auth used in future).

Principle of Least Privilege is applied.

4. Networking

VPC with private + public subnets:

RDS is deployed in private subnets (no internet access).

ECS tasks run in private subnets with a NAT Gateway for updates.

Load balancer sits in public subnets, facing users.

5. Docker Image Security

The Dockerfile uses a lightweight base image (e.g., python:3.11-slim) to reduce attack surface.

Python dependencies pinned in requirements.txt to avoid unexpected updates.

Optional: Can integrate Trivy scan in GitHub Actions pipeline for vulnerabilities.

6. GitHub Actions Security

Terraform backend S3 + DynamoDB uses encryption.

AWS credentials stored as GitHub Encrypted Secrets.

Prevents accidental leakage of keys.

âœ… So yes:

The poll.py backend + RDS are integrated with security best practices applied (private networking, secrets management, IAM least privilege, security groups, encrypted backend, and CI/CD secrets protection).
